% Assume nb_train.m has just been executed, and all the parameters computed/needed

% training set (i.e., the j-th column represents the same token in the test data 
% matrix as in the original training data matrix).

% Write code below to classify each document in the test set (ie, each row
% in the current document word matrix) as 1 for SPAM and 0 for NON-SPAM.

% Construct the (numTestDocs x 1) vector 'output' such that the i-th entry 
% of this vector is the predicted class (1/0) for the i-th  email (i-th row 
% in testMatrix) in the test set.
